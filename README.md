# MobX Graphlink

Integrate data from a GraphQL backend into MobX and React with declarative path requests. (built on Apollo)

### Installation

```
npm install mobx-graphlink --save-exact
```

The `--save-exact` flag is recommended (to disable version-extending), since this package uses [Explicit Versioning](https://medium.com/sapioit/why-having-3-numbers-in-the-version-name-is-bad-92fc1f6bc73c) (`Release.Breaking.FeatureOrFix`) rather than SemVer (`Breaking.Feature.Fix`).

For `FeatureOrFix` version-extending (recommended for libraries), prepend "`~`" in `package.json`. (for `Breaking`, prepend "`^`")
